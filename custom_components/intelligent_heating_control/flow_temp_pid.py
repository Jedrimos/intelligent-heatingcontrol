    Discrete PID controller with anti-windup for boiler flow temperature.

    The controller computes a corrected flow-temp setpoint based on the
    difference between the desired setpoint (calculated from the heating
    curve) and the actual measured flow temperature from a sensor.

    Anti-windup: the integral term is clamped to ±20°C equivalent so that
    a long period without sensor feedback cannot accumulate runaway errors.
